Version 0.16.0-alpha-1

This is a first public release of OpenJML based on OpenJDK16.
It is an alpha release and missing some significant functionality
(such as RAC, a windows build, and reasoning about lambda functions and anonymous classes).

However, it does implement some of the newer features of currnet OpenJDK, 
such as being an encapsulated standalone executable that does not need
Java installed (much less a particular version).
