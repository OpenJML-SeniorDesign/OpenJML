This is the primary repository for the OpenJML project. The active issues list for OpenJML development is [here](https://github.com/OpenJML/OpenJML/issues)
and the [wiki](https://github.com/OpenJML/OpenJML/wiki) contains information relevant to development. 
Public documentation for users is at the [project website](https://www.openjml.org).
In particular, there is a [tutorial](https://openjml.github.io/tutorial),
a [JML reference manual](https://openjml.github.io/documentation/JML-Reference_Manual.pdf),
an [OpenJML Reference Manual](https://openjml.github.io/documentation/OpenJMLUserGuide.pdf),
and other resources.

Releases numbered 0.16.X and following are installed simply by unzipping the downloaded release file into an empty directory of the user's choice.
The release includes the executable file ``openjml``, which implements OpenJML.
On Mac OS, you may need to execute the ``mac-setup`` script so that the Mac security system allows the OpenJML libraries to be executed.
The 0.16.X series of releases do not need a particular version (or any version) of Java installed.
